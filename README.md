# message_template_maker

A simple message template maker for creating messages for hotel guests.

## built with
    - JavaScript
    - jQuery
    - MomentJS

## Set up
    - fork and clone the project

## Design
    - layout to be added to the GUI
        - form in a column in a small / portrait mobile view
        - form in a row in a desktop / landscape mobile view

## Running the project
    I used an extension called Live Server working in the VS Code IDE. 
    Use Live Server or a nother similar extension for your chosen IDE.
    
    Choose options from the drop down menus on the GUI.
    An alternative message can be used by entering it in the text field. 
    Click Submit to view the generated message on the DOM.

## Language
    I used JavaScript and jQuery primarily because I have the most experience with the languages and knowledge of libraries to use.  I also use jQuery for the shortened and readable syntax of some jQuery methods.

## Process for Verifying Correctness
    I used console.log to test output of functions and find bugs and errors in the code.

## next steps:
    - rebuild in react 
    - implement a Node.JS server
    - unit testing
    - layout and styling
    - plan and test for edge cases
    - connect to twilio
