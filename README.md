# message_template_maker

A simple message template maker for creating messages for hotel guests.

## built with
    - JavaScript
    - jQuery
    - MomentJS

## Set up
    - fork and clone the project

## Running the project
    I used an extension called Live Server working in the VS Code IDE. 
    Use Live Server or a nother similar extension for your chosen IDE.

## Language
    I used JavaScript and jQuery primarily because I have the most experience with the languages and knowledge of libraries to use.  I also use jQuery for the shortened and readable syntax of some jQuery methods.

## Process for Verifying Correctness
    I used console.log to check output of functions and find bugs and errors in the code.

## next steps:
    - rebuild in react so I can conditionally render the alt message input
    - implement a Node.JS server
    - unit testing
    - layout and styling
    - plan and test for edge cases
    - connect to twilio
